THE WILD ROBOT REVIEW
A rather lovely vocal performance from Lupita Nyong’o anchors The Wild Robot, which is itself a wholly lovely film.
Adapted from the 2014 book by Peter Brown, the film arrives as yet one more hit from Lilo and Stitch director Chris Sanders,
who also gifted DreamWorks their How to Train Your Dragon franchise. In keeping with the studio’s recent move to a more painterly house style,
boasted here is a panopticon of sumptuous animation, giving rise to a rusticity in its artistic world building. 
Recalled are those classic Disney tales of zany forest critters and Walt’s own interest in the brutal beauty of the natural world. 
Added is contemporary interest in the rise of artificial intelligence, albeit with more nuance than most.
